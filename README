CSharp.Geeklist is a C# .NET wrapper for the Geeklist RESTful API.

It contains the following

  * OAuth connection support for Geeklist
  * API binding for Geeklist
  * ASP.NET MVC 3 example project
  * Console application example project

Things to keep in mind

  * The Geeklist API is beta and under active development.
  * I will do my best to keep up with changes.
  * Please create issues if you find anything not working.
  * The wrapper currently points to the sandbox for development and testing.
  * Jason Chapel has informed me Activities will recieve a major overhaul.
